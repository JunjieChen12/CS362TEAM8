## Product Description

### Abstract
Taskwise is a mobile productivity application designed to solve decision fatigue by intelligently automating task prioritization. Unlike standard to-do lists that merely store tasks, Taskwise uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze task urgency, user-defined time constraints, and historical completion data to recommend the optimal task to tackle next. This ensures users focus on execution rather than planning, maximizing productivity during their available time windows.

### Goal
Our goal is to reduce the friction between "listing a task" and "doing a task." We aim to help students and professionals who struggle with time management by providing a system that answers the question, "What should I do right now?" based on data rather than intuition.
