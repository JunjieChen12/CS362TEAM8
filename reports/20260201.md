# Week 4 Status Report - Taskwise

## Team Report

### Goals from Last Week
*  Finalize project scope and proposal document sections.
*  Create and polish 4-slide presentation deck.
*  Set up GitHub repository with README and reports folder.

### Progress and Issues
* **Repo Setup**: Successfully initialized the GitHub repository, created the `.gitignore`, and pushed the initial project skeleton.
* **Architecture**: Finalized the software architecture as **Client-Server (Flask + SQLite)** and updated the Living Document to reflect this decision.
* **Development**: Implemented the "Skeleton Code" (`app.py`), verifying that the database connects and tasks can be saved locally.
* **AI Strategy Pivot**: We encountered a scope issue with the machine learning component (lack of training data). We resolved this by pivoting to a **Heuristic Priority Engine** (Logic-based sorting) for the MVP.
* **Issues**: Resolved initial `ModuleNotFound` errors by standardizing the root folder execution for Flask.

### Plans for Next Week
* **Frontend**: Implement styling for the Task List and create the "Add Task" Modal.
* **Backend**: Implement the `DELETE` and `COMPLETE` routes in `app.py`.
* **AI Logic**: Write the Python logic for the priority sorting algorithm (`recommendation.py`).
* **Integration**: Verify that all team members can pull the skeleton code and run it locally without errors.

## Individual Contributions: Junjie Chen
### Goals from Last Week
*  Helped brainstorm ideas and clarify requirements

### Progress
*  Set up the GitHub repository and developed the core Flask application skeleton. Implemented the Task database model and the "Add Task" route to verify the database connection.
### Plans for Next Week
* Assit team members with implementing features setting up local environments and manage Pull Requests.

* ## Individual Contributions: Meiqi Ma
### Goals from Last Week
*  Create slide deck and presentation flow

### Progress
*   Researched the feasibility of scikit-learn vs. Heuristic algorithms. Designed the weighted priority formula (Score = Deadline + Duration) to replace the complex ML model for the MVP.
### Plans for Next Week
*   Create the recommendation.py module and implement the sorting function.

* ## Individual Contributions: Weiqian Xu
### Goals from Last Week
*  Defined backend architecture and identify necessary API endpoints

### Progress
*  Reviewed the Flask route structure in app.py. Planned the logic for the delete_task and complete_task functions to handle user actions.

### Plans for Next Week
*  Write the server-side code to handle task deletion and status updates.
